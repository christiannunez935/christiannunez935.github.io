    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Christian Nunez. I am a Sophomore Accoutning Major and Computer Science Minor. <br>
    I graduated from Cranston High School East here in Rhode Island and then went throught the Talent Development program here at the University of Rhode Island. <br><br><br>
Some things that I enjoy doing are playing video games, watching and participating in sports, and socializing with friends. <br>
When it comes to sports, I have a very wide area of favorite teams. For baseball, it's the Boston Red Sox; Football it's the New Orleans Saints; Basketball it's the Philadelphia 76ers. <br>
Video games are my #1 passion. I enjoy a wide variety of video games whether they are action, adventure, RPG, or even puzzle games. It just depends on the feeling I get for the game. <br>
For example, I play "Madden NFL". However, I also play games like "Dark Souls" and "God of War". It simply comes down to whether or not I think the game would be fairly enjoyable to play through. <br>
